# so-refactored

A work in progress to coordinate management of the Sequence Ontology (SO) with the proposed Molecular Sequence Ontology (MSO).  The MSO is an ontology in development for the description of the physical molecules that contain biologically relevant sequence, and their properties.  The SO, by contrast, represents the features of sequence as information entities.

## Versions

### Stable release versions

The latest version of the Sequence Ontology can always be found at:
